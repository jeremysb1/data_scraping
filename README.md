This project scrapes the YC Hacker News website for links to the stories with the top votes.

I used Python and the Beautiful Soup library (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).

While I built a simple web scraper for this project, ideally I would not do this. Instead I would initially look for an API. If the API I was looking for didn't exist, only then would I scrpae the data from scratch with the aid of an appropriate library.

While, HN does have an API (https://github.com/HackerNews/API). I wanted the practice of building from scratch.
